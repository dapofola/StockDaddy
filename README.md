# StockDaddy
Stock website side project I took on to model paper trading.

# To run:
1. I'd recommend using the command line/terminal for simplicity.
2. Ensure you're in the right directory (____)
3. Ensure you have all relevant Python libraries installed (they're listed in the file "requirements.txt")
4. Set up the flask environment (commands to run in command line are in the file "flask_config_file.txt"). Note that if you're not using Unix or MacOS, you may need to switch "export" with "set".
5. Run the command "flask run" and a local host link should be generated at the bottom of the terminal output. The line will start with "Running on [link]"
6. Copy-paste the link into your browser
7. Happy paper trading :)
